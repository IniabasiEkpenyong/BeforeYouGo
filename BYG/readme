Name: Judah Guggenheim

Contribution: I worked alone, and therefore contributed the
entirety of the code.

I received no help from other people (other than looking at
public ed posts and instructor responses).

Sources:
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#isinstance
(to determine if classid was an integer or not)
- Course-provided lectures and handouts; especially the
  Penny Flask handouts.

Time spent on the assignment: ~5 hours to code, ~4 more hours 
to test and improve style.

Assesment of assignment:
It was really exciting to see things come together, and to
actually create the basics of a webpage with evident
usefulness. It helped me learn what went into that, and
how to make use of existing tools to that effect.


Further information about my work:
I adapted my code from the basics of the Penny modules.
I probably should have changed the names of files early on,
but by the time I went back to it, I was nervous to break
something and therefore left the filenames as is.

Additionally, the smarter way to do error handling would 
probably be to make a seperate 'errmsg.html' file, and 
have penny.py decide which html file to make depending on
whether err_msg is empty or not. I'll aim to
incorportate that for the next assignment.
